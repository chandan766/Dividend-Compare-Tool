## Dividend Compare Tool

### Purpose of the Code
The **Dividend Compare Tool** is a GUI-based application built using the `tkinter` library in Python. The purpose of this code is to provide a user-friendly interface for comparing dividend-related information of different companies. The tool allows users to enter details such as the company name, share price, annual dividend, and number of shares. Users can then add this information to a table to compare various companies based on their dividend information.

### Key Features

- **Reset and Clear**: Users can reset all the entries in the table and clear individual input boxes to start over or correct any mistakes.
